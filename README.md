# Sikuli Programs for Student Senate 2017-18 Related Activities
An end of the year project lead my @oconnellamethyst to create various programs to increase the productivity of the 2017-18 Senate

### News
Hello world! The first program I will be creating is one that sets up Outlook, then I intend to create one that will do everything I am trying to do with Textbook Wiki. Au revoir!

### What is Student Senate?
Student Senate is exactly what it sounds like, Student Governance, but with a twist. See, as a Student Senate of a Minnesota State institution, it means that I have a student union, LeadMN that does things on the two-year college level, and also as a representative. We speak on behalf of the students, but, I have several office/IT/managerial tasks that I intend to automate in the following repository so that I can spend more time with the students.

### How do I work with this repository?
I'd rather you not try to contribute to this repository since I'm doing office things with it, but I am releasing the code under a copyleft license, so you are free to fork and do with what you will. I am mainly using [Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org/) in this repository. Also, I am using portable apps from PortableApps.com, specifically, Notepad++, GIMP, jPortable Launcher, as well as the official Git for Windows Portable release.
