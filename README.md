# Sikuli Programs for Student Senate 2017-18 Related Activities
An end of the year project lead my @oconnellamethyst to create various programs to increase the productivity of the 2017-18 Senate

### News
The addsenateinbox.sikuli script is a program that will add the Senate shared inbox automatically, I will write documentation for it shortly. The addsenateemail.sikuli is a program that theoretically sets up the inbox for the senate email, but hasn't been thoroughly tested yet. I might also create a program to hook up the Senate Drive, but that seems like an easy enough task to do by hand, so I might not. Once I have documented and tested these programs, I will hopefully tackle a program much more challenging: a program to pull information from the Bookstore, stick it in [Textbook Wiki](http://textbook.wikia.com/wiki/Textbook_Wiki), and match that information with Open Educational Resources, and Study Materials, a utopian ideal indeed! To be honest, I'm not sure if Sikuli is the best tool for this job, but I quite like Python, and I have experience in graphic design, so this type of workflow really jives with me. If it fits it ships for a low flat rate!

### What is Student Senate?
Student Senate is exactly what it sounds like, Student Governance, but with a twist. See, as a Student Senate of a Minnesota State institution, it means that I have a student union, LeadMN that does things on the two-year college level, and also as a representative. We speak on behalf of the students, but, I have several office/IT/managerial tasks that I intend to automate in the following repository so that I can spend more time with the students.

### How do I work with this repository?
I'd rather you not try to contribute to this repository since I'm doing office things with it, but I am releasing the code under a copyleft license, so you are free to fork and do with what you will, so long as you also spread the love. I am mainly using [Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org/) in this repository. Also, I am using portable apps from PortableApps.com, specifically, Notepad++, GIMP, jPortable Launcher, as well as the official Git for Windows Portable release.
